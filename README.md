# Architecture Special Interest Group

## Overview

This is the Special Interest Group for Architecture (industry-core-hub) within the Eclipse Tractus-X project. Our primary aim is to document the overall architecture from Tractus-X. Also this repository is a place were Tractus-X Architects can align and document the different design decisions that affect the Tractus-X Product as a whole. 

## Objectives

- define architecture guidelines for Eclipse Tractus-X Products
- document the architecture and how all the products come together as a whole
- document the design decisions of the project itself, regarding other dataspaces and organizations
- document the relationships in between products, aligning and keep things running in between the dependencies
- enable a fluid and synchronized integration of the Eclipse Tractus-X Dataspace, having a big picture how it comes together.
- easy the understanding for external technical viewers who want to learn how Tractus-X has been built from architectural point of view.
